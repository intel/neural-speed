# Changelog

## [v0.3.7](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.7) (2023-12-22)
- New Features
  * Enabled multi-SKUs support.
  * Refined the project’s coding conventions.
  * Cleaned up building warnings.
  * Upgraded the toolchain to oneAPI-2024.0.0
  * Updated documents, tests, and examples.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

## [v0.3.6](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.6) (2023-11-10)
- New Features
  * Added GEMM new feature for any shapes support (odd shapes).
  * Provided default configurations for GEMM API (users could get good performance by default configurations, only advanced users need to tune optimization options).
  * Supported converting register layout between tiled and linear.
  * Provided flexible large shape's APIs for other policy (e.g. splitk, improved mat_A & mat_B cache hit ratio).
  * Refined **mem_desc_t** and **payload_t** to expose alignment parameter.
  * Enabled epilogue to support **D = alpha * A * B + beta * C**.
  * Replaced **xetla_exec_item** with **sycl::nd_item**.
  * Refined some examples to invoke kernel level APIs, added fence and barrier to MLP example.
  * Fixed some known issues, enhanced tests, and updated documents.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

## [v0.3.5](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.5) (2023-09-28)
- New Features
  * Enhanced limitation checking.
  * Refined GEMM APIs’ name.
  * Supported GEMM APIs load B from SLM.
  * Supported GEMM of any (odd) shapes.
  * Supported Streaming-K.
  * Enhanced L3 K-slicing support.
  * Improved GEMM's performance for large-N (M, N, K) shapes.
  * Fixed tile load/store bugs.
  * Enhanced examples, tests, and updated documents.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

## [v0.3.4](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.4) (2023-08-18)
- New Features
  * Enabled limitation checking.
  * Provided "XETLA_PRINTF" and "XETLA_ASSERT" for debugging.
  * Refined fpu based GEMM.
  * Refined tile reduce APIs, deprecated API "tile_row_reduce".
  * Supported new data type int4 (experimental feature).
  * Fixed tile load/store bugs.
  * Enhanced examples, tests, and updated documents.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

 ## [v0.3.3](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.3) (2023-06-30)
- New Features
  * Enabled debug build support.
  * Updated documents, added some diagrams and details.
  * Fixed some customer reported issues.
  * Improved the project's quality.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

## [v0.3.2](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.2) (2023-06-16)
- New Features
  * Added some kernel-level APIs' parameters check functions, users need to explicit call them before launch the kernel; will return fail and print error messages when detect unsupported scenarios, continue launching the kernel for unspported scenarios may lead to unpredictable result.
  * Removed reduce_sum + tile_op epilogue policy.
  * Added some unit test cases.
  * Refined some examples code.
  * Updated documents, added some diagrams and details.
  * Fixed some customer reported issues.
  * Improved the project's quality.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

## [v0.3.1](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.1) (2023-05-22)
- New Features
  * Initial open source release.
  * Improved subgroup level fundamental features: core, tile, utils.
  * Enhanced basic BRGEMM micro-kernels for different data types as well as different epilogue flavours.
  * Unified the examples: basic BRGEMM, GEMM; fusion BRGEMM, GEMM; batched GEMM; MLP, GRU, MHA.
  * Added some unit test cases.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).
