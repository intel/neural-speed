# Neural Speed

Neural Speed is an innovation library designed to provide the efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) on Intel platforms through the state-of-the-art (SOTA) low-bit quantization and sparsity powered by [Intel Neural Compressor](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). Highlights of this project:

- Support LLAMA, LLAMA2, NeuralChat series, GPT-J, GPT-NEOX, Dolly-v2, MPT, Falcon, BLOOM, OPT, ChatGLM, ChatGLM2, Baichuan, Baichuan2, Qwen, Mistral, Whisper, CodeLlama, MagicCoder and StarCoder
- [Highly optimized low precision kernels](neural_speed/core/README.md), utilize AMX, VNNI, AVX512F, AVX_VNNI and AVX2 instruction set
- Up to 40x compared with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), performance details: [blog](https://medium.com/@NeuralCompressor/llm-performance-of-intel-extension-for-transformers-f7d061556176) 
- NeurIPS' 2023: [Efficient LLM Inference on CPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00502)
- Support 4bits and 8bits quantization
- Tensor Parallelism across sockets/nodes: [tensor_parallelism.md](./docs/tensor_parallelism.md)

> Neural Speed is under active development so APIs are subject to change.

## Installation

### Build Python package (Recommended way)
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

>**Note**: Please make sure GCC version is higher than GCC 10.


## Quick Start
There are two approaches for utilizing the Neural Speed: 1. Transformer-like usage, you need to install [ITREX(intel extension for transformers)](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers) 2. llama.cpp-like usage

### 1. Transformer-like usage

Pytorch format HF model
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer
from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model_name = "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-1"     # Hugging Face model_id or local model
prompt = "Once upon a time, there existed a little girl,"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, load_in_4bit=True)
outputs = model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=300)
```
>**Note**: For llama2/ mistral/ neural_chat/ codellama/ magicoder/ chatglmv1/v2/ baichuan models, we can only support the local path to model for now.
GGUF format HF model
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer
from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

# Specify the GGUF repo on the Hugginface
model_name = "TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF"
# Download the the specific gguf model file from the above repo
model_file = "llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf"
# make sure you are granted to access this model on the Huggingface.
tokenizer_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"

prompt = "Once upon a time"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name, trust_remote_code=True)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, model_file = model_file)
outputs = model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=300)
```

You can also use [Transformer-based API](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers/blob/main/docs/weightonlyquant.md#llm-runtime-example-code) in [ITREX(intel extension for transformers)](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers), but you need to install Intel Extension for Transformers.

### 2. llama.cpp-like usage:

#### One-click Python scripts
Run LLM with one-click python script including conversion, quantization and inference.
```
python scripts/run.py model-path --weight_dtype int4 -p "She opened the door and see"
```

#### Quantize and Inference Step By Step
Neural Speed supports 1. GGUF models generated by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) 2. GGUF models from HuggingFace 3. PyTorch model from HuggingFace, but quantized by Neural Speed
Neural Speed offers the scripts: 1) convert and quantize, and 2) inference for conveting the model by yourself.
If the GGUF model is from HuggingFace or generated by llama.cpp, you can inference it directly.


##### 1. Convert and Quantize LLM
converting the model by following the below steps:

```bash
# convert the model directly use model id in Hugging Face. (recommended)
python scripts/convert.py --outtype f32 --outfile ne-f32.bin EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b
```
##### 2. Inference

Linux and WSL

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=<physic_cores> numactl -m 0 -C 0-<physic_cores-1> python scripts/inference.py --model_name llama -m ne-q4_j.bin -c 512 -b 1024 -n 256 -t <physic_cores> --color -p "She opened the door and see"
```

Windows
```bash
python scripts/inference.py --model_name llama -m ne-q4_j.bin -c 512 -b 1024 -n 256 -t <physic_cores|P-cores> --color -p "She opened the door and see"
```

You find find more deatils such as validated GGUF models from HuggingFace in [list](./docs/supported_models.md).



Neural Speed also supports GGUF models generated by [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), you need to download the model and use llama.cpp to create it. Validated models: [llama2-7b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf), [falcon-7b](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b), [falcon-40b](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b), [mpt-7b](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b), [mpt-40b](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-40b) and [bloom-7b1](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-7b1).


## Advanced Usage

### 1. Quantization and inferenece
More parameters in llama.cpp-like usage: [Advanced Usage](./docs/advanced_usage.md).

### 2. Tensor Parallelism cross nodes/sockets

We support tensor parallelism strategy for distributed inference/training on multi-node and multi-socket. You can refer to [tensor_parallelism.md](./docs/tensor_parallelism.md) to enable this feature.

### 3. Custom Stopping Criteria

You can customize the stopping criteria according to your own needs by processing the input_ids to determine if text generation needs to be stopped.
Here is the document of Custom Stopping Criteria: [simple example with minimum generation length of 80 tokens](./docs/customized_stop.md)

### 4. Verbose Mode

Enable verbose mode and control tracing information using the `NEURAL_SPEED_VERBOSE` environment variable.

Available modes:
- 0: Print all tracing information. Comprehensive output, including: evaluation time and operator profiling. (need to set `NS_PROFILING` to ON and recompile)
- 1: Print evaluation time. Time taken for each evaluation.
- 2: Profile individual operator. Identify performance bottleneck within the model. (need to set `NS_PROFILING` to ON and recompile)


## Enable New Model
You can consider adding your own models, please follow the document: [graph developer document](./developer_document.md).
